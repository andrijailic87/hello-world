My data from CS50 course

Hi all! 

I'm Andrija, mechanical engineer, working in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) which is the touchpoint between enterprise systems and mechanical engineering. 
Since I do a lot of work in business analysis, solution architecture and development decisions, I need to understand enterprise/PLM system very well. 
That includes understanding it's data model, functionalities, item types, attributes and so on... 
To have a deep dive into computer science, CS50 seems like a best way to go! 

Welcome to my first Git Commit! 

Kind regards,
Andrija
